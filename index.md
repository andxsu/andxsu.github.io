## About Me

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UCLA studying Physics & Computer Science. I am currently working for Professor Jay Hauser at UCLA on a project to visualize particle collision events at the CMS in Virtual Reality. Last summer, I worked on theoretical topological quantum error correction at Brookhaven National Laboratory under Dr. Layla Hormozi. I'm continuing that research this Fall under BNL's SURP program.

## Research Interests

- **Quantum Computing:** topological quantum computing, superconducting qubits, QC for Lattice QCD, circuit quantum electrodynamics, quantum networking
- **Quantum Error Correction:**  topological quantum error correcting codes
- **Miscellaneous:** [financial modeling with physics](https://doi.org/10.1177/29767032241279990), robotic automation, scalable aerospace
