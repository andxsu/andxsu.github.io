## About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate student at UCLA studying Physics & Computer Science. I am currently working for Professor Jay Hauser at UCLA on a project to visualize particle collision events at the CMS in Virtual Reality. I will be working on topological quantum error correction this summer at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 

## Research Interests

- **Quantum Computing:** topological quantum computing, superconducting qubits, variational quantum algorithms, quantum optimization algorithms
- **Quantum Error Correction:**  topological quantum error correcting codes
